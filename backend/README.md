## How to run the backend "server"

If you don't want to run `node index.js` every single tine, install [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

```
npm install nodemon --save
```

You could run ``nodemon index.js`` everytime, but since we're boring, I added a script to `package.json`
Simply type

```
npm start
```
and enjoy your live server (Port 3000)!
